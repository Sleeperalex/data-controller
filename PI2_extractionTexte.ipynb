The incident would likely have \\nbeen avoided if the company had governance and oversight procedures in place. \\nIndications of a structural issue may include executive misconduct, a history of \\nignoring warnings or a pattern of incidents across locations or business units. \\nNon-Structural:\\n The controversy appears to be linked to misfortune or rogue \\nemployees rather than poor management or governance failures.

MSCI ESG Controversies assessments aim to \\nmeasure companies' reputational/brand risk based on alleged involvement in \\nadverse impact activities as reported by the media, nongovernmental organizations \\n(NGOs), civil society groups, academia, regulators and other stakeholders. \\nCases include alleged company violations of existing laws and/or regulations to \\nwhich they are subject to, or an alleged company action or event that violates \\ncommonly accepted international norms, including, but not limited to, global norms \\nand conventions, such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Fundamental \\nConventions.\\nA case can be a single event such as a spill, accident or regulatory action, or a set of \\nclosely linked events or allegations such as health and safety fines at the same \\nfacility, multiple allegations of anticompetitive behavior related to the same product \\nline, multiple community protests at the same company location, or multiple \\nindividual lawsuits alleging the same type of discrimination.  \\nThe MSCI ESG Controversies analytical framework organizes ESG controversies \\nwithin three Pillars: Environment, Social and Governance. In particular, the Social \\nPillar is further divided into three Sub-Pillars representing different stakeholders: \\ncommunity (Human Rights & Community Impact Sub-Pillar), workers (Labor Rights & \\nSupply Chain Sub-Pillar) and customers (Customers Sub-Pillar).  \\nPillars and Sub-Pillars are further divided into 28 Themes (see Exhibit 1). All \\nassessed ESG controversy cases are associated with at least one Theme. Since a \\nsingle event or an ongoing situation may have a broad array of implications, such an \\nevent may result in MSCI ESG Research profiling multiple ESG controversy cases in \\ndifferent Themes. For example, an oil spill incident may result in the profiling of an \\nESG controversy case assessing alleged impact on the local ecosystem (under the \\nBiodiversity and Land Use Theme) and a separate case assessing alleged impact on \\nthe local population (under the Impact on Local Communities Theme). Each case is \\n For all references to laws, rules or regulations, please note that the information is provided \"as is\" and does \\nnot constitute legal advice or any binding interpretation.

                             An ESG controversy case is created when allegations concerning an event or a \\ncompany's practices, products or businesses could lead to reputational risk due to \\ntheir potential negative environmental, social and/or governance impact.  \\nMSCI ESG Research analytical personnel identify new ESG controversy cases and \\nupdate existing cases by researching companies' public documents, media sources \\nand nongovernmental organization publications. Please refer to \"MSCI ESG \\nControversies and Global Norms Methodology - Process\" for details on the \\nfrequency of updates, sources and review process.\\nExhibit 3: Assessments made for a controversy case \\nFor each ESG controversy case, MSCI ESG Research determines: \\nSeverity \\nof the case based on the nature of harm and scale of alleged \\nimpact, and application of specific exacerbating or extenuating \\ncircumstances: Very Severe, Severe, Moderate or Minor. \\nRole \\nof the company implicated in the case: Direct or Indirect.  \\nStatus \\nof the case: Concluded, Partially Concluded, Ongoing, Archived or \\nHistorical Concern. \\n All information considered in such an assessment must meet the criteria set out in the ESG Controversies \\nsources section of \"MSCI ESG Controversies and Global Norms Methodology - Process.\" In general, we do not \\nuse sanctions lists, trade restrictions, or other \"black\" lists of companies operating in a specific territory as a \\nsource of ESG controversies. These sources typically do not include specific allegations against companies or \\ndetails on specific adverse impacts associated with companies' actions or products. If such allegations are \\nfound in other sources, they will be processed similarly to all other controversies, assessing the severity of the \\nallegations, the company's role, and the status of the resolution. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 10 OF 53\\nBased on these three inputs, an overall Score and a corresponding Flag are \\ndetermined for each of the ESG controversy cases. \\nWritten summaries for Severe and Very Severe cases provide details of each \\ncontroversy and are included in each company's MSCI ESG Controversies report.     \n",

alleged \\nScale of Impact of the event, practices, products or businesses on the environment \\nand society. In some instances, the Severity assessment can be adjusted based on \\nexacerbating circumstances that include activities constituting deliberate action with \\nregard to social or environmental harm, or involve the most vulnerable ecosystems \\nor demographic groups. The Severity assessment may also be adjusted due to \\nextenuating circumstances. This adjustment is applied if a case is determined to be \\nlinked to a legacy issue that continues to present a reputational or legal risk to the \\ncompany.  \\nNature of Harm  \\nThe Nature of Harm is assessed on a scale ranging from Very Serious to Minimal \\nharm: \\nExhibit 4: Nature of Harm scale \\nVery Serious harm generally applies to events and actions that lead to irretrievable or \\nlong-lasting damage to the environment, result in fatalities, contribute to major \\nfinancial or economic crisis, or correspond to a most serious crime against \\nhumanity. \\nMinimal harm generally refers to cases where actual impact is projected in the \\nfuture. This includes cases alleging adverse impact of planned or forthcoming \\nactions, for example, protests against the construction of an oil pipeline based on \\nconcerns over possible adverse impact on land and water resources. \\nThe Scale of Impact is assessed on a scale ranging from Extremely Widespread to \\nLow. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 11 OF 53\\nExhibit 5: Scale of Impact \\nThe Scale of Impact is an assessment of the extent of the alleged harm and is \\ndetermined, for example, based on the size of the area or number of people affected, \\nthe size of the operating footprint of companies involved in high-impact controversial \\nactivity, and the number of regions or jurisdictions affected by high-impact \\ncontroversial business practices. Low Scale of Impact is attributed to controversies \\nthat have an undeterminable, but probable extent of harm where the impact is likely \\nto be insignificant. \\nSee Appendix B for more details and examples of Nature of Harm and Scale of \\nImpact assessments. \\nCombining Nature of Harm and Scale of Impact \\n and \\nScale of Impact\\n assessments are combined to reach an initial \\ndetermination of Severity; multiple scenarios can lead to the same Severity \\nassessment (see Exhibit 6). \\nExhibit 6: Initial assessment of controversy case Severity \\nNature of Harm \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 12 OF 53\\nExacerbating Circumstances \\nCertain circumstances may warrant a controversy case Severity assessment to be \\nadjusted: cases that have an Exacerbating Circumstance have a controversy \\nassessment that is more severe than otherwise would have been determined \\nthrough the Nature of Harm and Scale of Impact alone.  \\nExacerbating circumstances can be assessed if any of the following three criteria are \\nmet: \\n1)\\nVulnerable demographics\\nmost vulnerable demographics. See Appendix C for more details. \\n2)\\nVulnerable ecosystems\\nmost vulnerable ecosystems. MSCI ESG Research defines vulnerable \\necosystems as those included on the United Nations Educational, \\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List. \\n3)\\nDeliberate action\\n: controversy cases that arise from allegations that the \\ncompany, company's representatives or employees are involved in \\nactivities constituting deliberate action with regard to social or \\nenvironmental harm. These may include deliberate obstruction of \\ninvestigations, attempts to cover up the event or activity, or the \\npunishment or termination of employees voicing their concerns or \\nparticipating in protests against the company.  \\nExtenuating Circumstances \\nCertain situations may warrant a controversy case Severity assessment to be \\nadjusted based on extenuating circumstances. Cases that face such Extenuating \\nCircumstances have a controversy assessment that is less severe than otherwise \\nwould have been determined through the Nature of Harm and Scale of Impact alone.  \\nExtenuating Circumstances are assessed if a case is determined to be linked to a \\nlegacy issue that continues to present a reputational or legal risk to the company.  \\nMSCI ESG Research defines a legacy issue as the following: \\nA high-impact event that occurred 20 or more years ago (e.g., use of prison labor \\nduring World War II); or  \\nA high-impact product or practice that was discontinued and/or remediated 20 or \\nmore years ago (e.g., asbestos, lead paint, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], \\nperfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA][in some cases], perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl \\nsubstances [PFAS], hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], etc.). \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 13 OF 53\\nExhibit 7: Example of Severity assessment with exacerbating and extenuating \\ncircumstances triggers applied    \n",

The Role is assessed as either \\nDirect or Indirect. \\nMSCI ESG Research consider companies to have a direct involvement in an ESG \\ncontroversy if the negative impact is directly attributed to the company's actions, \\npractices, products or businesses; whereby harm could not have happened without \\nsuch actions or activities; or if the ESG controversy relates to an entity or a joint \\nventure in which the company has significant control. MSCI ESG Research's \\ndetermination of significant control is based specifically on the ownership structure \\nas disclosed by the company. If an entity has 30% ownership or higher or is a primary \\noperator in a joint venture project, it is assessed as having significant control.  \\nA company is implicated in a workplace incident that led to several employee \\nfatalities. \\nAn oil refining company is facing substantial community opposition to a pipeline \\nconstruction project that is carried out by a subsidiary of the company, of which \\nit owns 30% of the shares. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 14 OF 53\\nA medical device manufacturer is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by patients \\nwho sustained injuries linked to malfunction of the company's pacemakers. \\nMSCI ESG Research considers companies to have an indirect involvement in an ESG \\ncontroversy when the negative impact may have been facilitated by the company's \\nactions, practices, products or businesses, but the company is not considered as \\nplaying critical or essential role (e.g., it is involved as a supplier or a client of a \\ndirectly involved company, or when the company had a minority ownership (<30%) in \\na company or joint venture involved in an ESG controversy case). Indirect Role is also \\nattributed to companies in cases of adverse impact due to natural causes (e.g., \\nearthquake, tsunami), whereby the company is still responsible for impact \\nremediation. \\nA company faces allegations of unsafe working conditions at one of its \\nsupplier's factories. \\nAn oil refining company is facing community opposition to a pipeline \\nconstruction project. The project is managed by a joint venture, in which the \\nrefining company holds 20% ownership. \\nA medical device distributor is linked to a controversy related to a class-action \\nlawsuit filed by patients who sustained injuries linked to malfunction of \\npacemakers. The pacemakers are produced by one of the firms whose products \\nare sold by the distribution company. \\nAs events unfold or additional information becomes available, the company's Role is \\nreassessed as warranted.    \n",

methodology for case assessment was \\nupdated in June 2022 and is effective for controversy cases initiated or reviewed \\nafter June 20, 2022. On that date, the case assessment transitioned from the prior \\nmethodology to the methodology described in Sections 1.1 to 1.5 above.  \\nControversy cases last reviewed prior to June 20, 2022, are assessed based on the \\nprior methodology. The prior methodology differs from the current methodology in \\nthe following ways: \\nThe prior methodology used Controversy Types (Structural or Non-Structural) \\ndistinguishing instances of systematic and repetitive allegations suggesting a \\npattern of corporate behavior instead of company Roles (Direct or Indirect) to \\ndetermine Controversy Scores. \\nThe prior methodology did not include a Partially Concluded Status.  \\n The MSCI ESG Controversies methodology outlined in this document is effective for controversy cases \\nreviewed after June 20, 2022. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 19 OF 53\\nUnder the prior methodology, a score of 0 and a corresponding Red Flag was \\napplied to all cases assessed as Very Severe, regardless of other criteria. \\nPrior to the introduction of the Company Role assessment, to determine whether \\na case extended to a related company, an evaluation was applied of whether the \\nrelated companies were under common control and shared senior leadership (or \\nsenior leadership who were first-degree relatives). \\nControversy Type Assessment \\nFor cases last reviewed prior to June 20, 2022, the assessment of Controversy Types \\napplied the following definitions: \\nStructural:\\n evidence suggests an underlying problem at the company -- poor \\nculture, or lack of adequate governance and oversight -- that caused or \\ncontributed to the occurrence of the controversy. The incident would likely have \\nbeen avoided if the company had governance and oversight procedures in place. \\nIndications of a structural issue may include executive misconduct, a history of \\nignoring warnings or a pattern of incidents across locations or business units. \\nNon-Structural:\\n The controversy appears to be linked to misfortune or rogue \\nemployees rather than poor management or governance failures. Better \\ngovernance and oversight could not reasonably have been expected to prevent it. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 20 OF 53\\nExhibit 9: Discontinued ESG controversy case scoring matrix (applied to cases last \\nreviewed prior to June 20, 2022) \\nNote: Some companies' cases may still have reflected prior scoring methodology during the \\ntransitional period.  \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 21 OF 53   \n",

                                                 As the objective of MSCI ESG Controversies assessments is to highlight reputational \\nrisk to a company based on its alleged involvement in controversial practices or \\nevents, no averaging or weight adjustment of scores is applied. An Overall Company \\nScore is generally determined based on the lowest-scoring controversy case in which \\nthe company is involved. Unless there is a pattern of controversial involvement \\nwithin a specific Theme, this approach is applied through the entire ESG \\ncontroversies hierarchy structure (see Exhibit 11 for a detailed example): \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 22 OF 53\\nThematic Indicators receive the score corresponding to the lowest-scoring \\ncontroversy case within the same Theme. An additional score deduction may \\napply if a pattern of involvement in similar cases is established. \\nSub-Pillars receive the score corresponding to the lowest scoring Thematic \\nIndicator within the Sub-Pillar. \\nPillars receive the score corresponding to the lowest-scoring Sub-Pillar within \\nthe Pillar. \\nThe company's Overall Score is ultimately determined by the lowest-scoring \\nPillar. \\nExhibit 11: ESG Controversy Score propagation through the ESG controversies \\nhierarchy \\nExample: A company is not involved in any major environmental or governance controversies, but is \\ndirectly involved in an Ongoing Very Severe (Red Flag) case alleging use of child labor in an ethnic \\ncommunity subjected to systemic abuse, and three instances of workplace safety violations, two of \\nwhich resulted in injuries to several workers (Yellow Flags). \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 23 OF 53\\nTreatment of more than three cases within the same Theme \\nIn situations where companies have three or more non-Minor controversy cases \\nwithin the same Theme, the Theme Score is reduced by 1 point. This rule applies \\nonly at the Thematic Indicator level to reflect the greater reputational risk associated \\nwith multiple controversies of similar impact. There is no pattern-based score \\nadjustment within the same Sub-Pillar or Pillar. Cases with a score of 1 (Orange Flag) \\nor 0 (Red Flag) always result in a Thematic Indicator score of 1 or 0, respectively. \\nExhibit 12: Example: ESG Controversy Score propagation for a company with three \\nor more Product Safety & Quality controversies \\nScores across individual cases, Thematic Indicators, Sub-Pillars, Pillars and at the \\ncompany level translate to a corresponding color Flag indicating the Severity of \\ncontroversies in which the company is involved. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 24 OF 53\\nExhibit 13: Interpretation of a Company Flag \\nFlag\\nFlag Description\\nRed Flag:\\n indicates that a company is directly involved in one or more \\nVery Severe Ongoing controversies. \\nOrange Flag:\\n indicates that a company has either: \\ninvolvement in one or more Very Severe controversies,  \\ncontroversies, or \\nIs directly involved in one or more Ongoing Severe controversies. \\nYellow Flag:\\nHas been implicated in one or more Concluded Very Severe or \\nSevere controversies,  \\nHas settled at least some of the stakeholders' concerns related to \\nits alleged involvement in one or more Severe controversies or \\nindirect involvement in one or more Very Severe controversies, or \\ncontroversies.  \\nGreen Flag:\\nHas fully or partially settled one or more Moderate severity \\ncontroversies in which it was directly involved,  \\nIs indirectly implicated in one or more Moderate controversies, \\nPartially Concluded or Concluded Minor controversies, or \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 25 OF 53   \n",

Principles 1 and \\n2 of the UNGC also refer to the UNGP.  \\nThese global norms and conventions vary in terms of scope, structure, primary \\naddressee, and types of recommendations. From a thematic perspective, the OECD \\nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises may be viewed as the broadest of the global \\nnorms, while ILO Fundamental Conventions and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental \\nPrinciples and Rights at Work have the narrowest scope, covering only labor rights.  \\nHowever, even where a topic is covered by two or more of these norms and \\nconventions, the expectations for the topic under each of them may vary. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 28 OF 53\\nExhibit 15: Thematic intersection between MSCI ESG Controversies and Global \\nHuman \\nRights \\nCensorship & Surveillance \\nControversial Regions \\nControversial Sourcing \\nIndigenous Peoples' Rights \\nForced/Slave Labor \\nKidnapping & Attacks \\nWorking Conditions/Pay \\nDiscrimination & Harassment \\nOpposition to Unions/ \\nUnionization \\nEnvironment \\nLand Use & Logging \\nBiodiversity & Endangered \\nSpecies \\nMarine Biodiversity \\nElectronic Waste \\nPackaging Material & Waste \\nPesticides/ Persistent \\nOrganic Pollutants \\nToxic Releases to \\nAir/Water/Land \\nOil Spill \\nEconomic & \\nBusiness \\nBribery & Corruption \\nMoney Laundering \\nImport/Export Violations \\nPredatory Lending \\nFraud & Billing \\nRestricted Access to \\nProducts/ Services \\nMisleading Claims \\nPesticides, Chemical Safety \\n The ILO's fundamental conventions and Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (excluding \\nhealth and safety). \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 29 OF 53\\nProduct & Service \\nSafety/Quality \\nStructural Integrity & \\nMaterials \\nCommunity \\nDevelopment \\nEvaluation Types  \\nThe following MSCI ESG Global Norms screens assess companies based on their \\ninvolvement in ESG Controversies that potentially conflict with the recommendations \\ndefined by each global norm or convention.

Governance \\nStructures issues.  \\nFor Business Ethics issues, Scale of Impact is generally measured by size of the \\nmarket or government affected, or the degree to which either company executives or \\nexternal parties such as government officials were involved. \\nFor Governance Structures issues, measurements of the Scale of Impact vary \\ndepending on the nature of the ESG controversy but generally include metrics such \\nas the percentage of shareholder votes or number of shareholders voicing an \\nopinion, number and position of executives or directors involved, number and type of \\nexternal parties voicing an opinion, or the portion of the company that is affected or \\nimplicated. Measures of the Nature of Harm are focused around impacts on \\ninvestment value and on shareholder rights. Most cases are assumed to be of \\nmedium impact, barring circumstances that go beyond typical scenarios and \\nindicating more serious harm.  \\nMeasures of the Nature of Harm vary by the type of violation that occurred and \\ninclude factors such as financial impact on the company or other impacted parties, \\nthe value of bribes or ill-gotten gains and other negative impacts that resulted from \\nillicit or unethical activities. \\nGlobal or 3+ G20 countries involved, \\n1,000+ people involved. \\n1 of G20 countries or 3+ non-G20 \\ncountries involved, 25+ people involved. \\n1-2 non-G20 countries/local \\nmunicipalities involved, 10-24 people \\ninvolved. \\nActivity substantially destabilized a \\nnational government or economy.  \\nTotal bribes paid or losses to company \\nexceed USD 1B or value of contracts or \\nother ill-gotten gains (e.g., taxes \\navoided) obtained exceeds USD 10B.  \\nActivity bankrupts the company or a \\nnon-govt customer; material financial \\nimpact on a govt body (incl public \\npension funds).  \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 44 OF 53\\nTotal bribes paid exceed USD 100M or \\nValue of contracts obtained exceeds \\nUSD 5B. \\nCorruption & fraud allegations among \\nbusiness entities, not affecting \\nindividual customers \\nMost corruption & government fraud \\nactivities: harm is real but diffused.  \\nImpact is projected or not scoped out \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 45 OF 53   \n",

While the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \\nPeoples does not include a definition of indigenous people, self-identification as \\nindigenous is considered a fundamental criterion. \\nThe UN identifies common factors among indigenous populations: \\nA historical continuity with a given region prior to colonization and a strong link \\nto their lands.  \\nDistinct social, economic and political systems.  \\nDistinct languages, cultures, beliefs and knowledge systems.  \\nSystematic abuse of indigenous populations specifically is defined by the UN \\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Article 8 and includes: \\nAny action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as \\ndistinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities. \\nAny action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, \\nterritories or resources. \\nAny form of forced population transfer which has the aim or effect of violating or \\nundermining any of their rights. \\nAny form of forced assimilation or integration. \\nAny form of propaganda designed to promote or incite racial or ethnic \\ndiscrimination directed against them.\"\\nRefugees \\nThe United Nations defines refugees as \"persons who are outside their country of \\norigin for reasons of feared persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or other \\ncircumstances that have seriously disturbed public order and, as a result, require \\ninternational protection.\" \\n United Nations. 2008. \\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\\n.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.  \\nThe Information may include \"Signals,\" defined as quantitative attributes or the product of methods or formulas that describe or are derived from \\ncalculations using historical data. Neither these Signals nor any description of historical data are intended to provide investment advice or a \\nrecommendation to make (or refrain from making) any investment decision or asset allocation and should not be relied upon as such. Signals are \\ninherently backward-looking because of their use of historical data, and they are not intended to predict the future. The relevance, correlations and \\naccuracy of Signals frequently will change materially. \\nThe Information should not be relied on and is not a substitute for the skill, judgment and experience of the user, its management, employees, advisors \\nand/or clients when making investment and other business decisions. All Information is impersonal and not tailored to the needs of any person, entity \\nor group of persons. \\nNone of the Information constitutes an offer to sell (or a solicitation of an offer to buy), any security, financial product or other investment vehicle or any \\ntrading strategy.  \\nIt is not possible to invest directly in an index. Exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represented by an index is only available \\nthrough third party investable instruments (if any) based on that index. MSCI does not issue, sponsor, endorse, market, offer, review or otherwise express \\nany opinion regarding any fund, ETF, derivative or other security, investment, financial product or trading strategy that is based on, linked to or seeks to \\nprovide an investment return related to the performance of any MSCI index (collectively, \"Index Linked Investments\"). MSCI makes no assurance that \\nany Index Linked Investments will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns. MSCI Inc. is not an investment adviser or \\nfiduciary and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in any Index Linked Investments. \\nIndex returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates indexes, but does not manage \\nactual assets. The calculation of indexes and index returns may deviate from the stated methodology. Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales \\ncharges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or Index Linked Investments. The imposition of these fees and \\ncharges would cause the performance of an Index Linked Investment to be different than the MSCI index performance. \\nThe Information may contain back tested data. Back-tested performance is not actual performance, but is hypothetical. There are frequently material \\ndifferences between back tested performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strategy.  \\nConstituents of MSCI equity indexes are listed companies, which are included in or excluded from the indexes according to the application of the relevant \\nindex methodologies. Accordingly, constituents in MSCI equity indexes may include MSCI Inc., clients of MSCI or suppliers to MSCI. Inclusion of a security \\nwithin an MSCI index is not a recommendation by MSCI to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice. \\nData and information produced by various affiliates of MSCI Inc., including MSCI ESG Research LLC and Barra LLC, may be used in calculating certain \\nMSCI indexes. More information can be found in the relevant index methodologies on www.msci.com.  \\nMSCI receives compensation in connection with licensing its indexes to third parties. MSCI Inc.'s revenue includes fees based on assets in Index Linked \\nInvestments.

MSCI ESG Controversies assessments aim to \\nmeasure companies' reputational/brand risk based on alleged involvement in \\nadverse impact activities as reported by the media, nongovernmental organizations \\n(NGOs), civil society groups, academia, regulators and other stakeholders. \\nCases include alleged company violations of existing laws and/or regulations to \\nwhich they are subject to, or an alleged company action or event that violates \\ncommonly accepted international norms, including, but not limited to, global norms \\nand conventions, such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Fundamental \\nConventions.\\nA case can be a single event such as a spill, accident or regulatory action, or a set of \\nclosely linked events or allegations such as health and safety fines at the same \\nfacility, multiple allegations of anticompetitive behavior related to the same product \\nline, multiple community protests at the same company location, or multiple \\nindividual lawsuits alleging the same type of discrimination.  \\nThe MSCI ESG Controversies analytical framework organizes ESG controversies \\nwithin three Pillars: Environment, Social and Governance. In particular, the Social \\nPillar is further divided into three Sub-Pillars representing different stakeholders: \\ncommunity (Human Rights &amp; Community Impact Sub-Pillar), workers (Labor Rights &amp; \\nSupply Chain Sub-Pillar) and customers (Customers Sub-Pillar).  \\nPillars and Sub-Pillars are further divided into 28 Themes (see Exhibit 1). All \\nassessed ESG controversy cases are associated with at least one Theme. Since a \\nsingle event or an ongoing situation may have a broad array of implications, such an \\nevent may result in MSCI ESG Research profiling multiple ESG controversy cases in \\ndifferent Themes. For example, an oil spill incident may result in the profiling of an \\nESG controversy case assessing alleged impact on the local ecosystem (under the \\nBiodiversity and Land Use Theme) and a separate case assessing alleged impact on \\nthe local population (under the Impact on Local Communities Theme). Each case is \\n For all references to laws, rules or regulations, please note that the information is provided \"as is\" and does \\nnot constitute legal advice or any binding interpretation.

ESG \\nanalytical personnel review the reported allegations and assign a score and a color-\\ncoded flag for each controversy case, based on the Severity of Impact in each case, \\nthe alleged Role of the company in each case and the Status of each case (which is \\ndetermined by the state of resolutions, if any, between involved stakeholders).  \\nExhibit 1: MSCI ESG Controversies thematic framework \\nEach ESG controversy case is assessed for the Severity of its impact on society or \\nthe environment as Very Severe, Severe, Moderate or Minor.  \\nEach ESG controversy case receives a Score and an associated color-coded Flag \\nbased on a combination of the assessed Severity of the controversy as well as the \\nassessments of the company's alleged Role and the Status of the case remediation \\nand resolution (see Exhibit 2).  \\nWhere a company has multiple ESG controversy cases, the Overall Company Score \\nand the corresponding Flag are determined by the lowest-scoring case. \\nENVIRONMENT\\nBiodiversity &amp; Land \\nUse \\nEnergy &amp; Climate \\nChange\\nWater Stress\\nToxic Emissions &amp; \\nWaste\\n(Non Hazardous)\\nSOCIAL\\nHUMAN RIGHTS &amp; \\nCOMMUNITY \\nIMPACT\\nImpact on Local \\nCommunities\\nConcerns\\nCivil Liberties\\nLABOR RIGHTS &amp; \\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\nChild Labor\\nCollective\\nBargaining &amp; \\nUnions\\nDiscrimination &amp; \\nWorkforce \\nDiversity\\nLabor Standards\\nHealth &amp; Safety\\nCUSTOMERS\\nProduct Safety &amp; \\nQuality\\nAnticompetitive \\nPractices\\nMarketing &amp; \\nAdvertising\\nPrivacy &amp; Data \\nSecurity\\nGOVERNANCE\\nBribery &amp; Fraud\\nControversial \\nInvestments\\nStructures\\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 7 OF 53\\nA company-level Overall Flag indicates the following: \\nA Red Flag indicates that a company is directly involved in one or more Very \\nSevere Ongoing controversies. \\nAn Orange Flag indicates that a company has either: \\ndirect involvement in one or more Very Severe controversies;  \\ncontroversies; or  \\nIs directly involved in one or more Severe controversies.  \\nA Yellow Flag indicates that a company either:  \\nHas been implicated in one or more Concluded Very Severe or Severe \\ncontroversies;  \\nHas settled most or all of the stakeholders' concerns related to its \\nalleged direct involvement in one or more Severe controversies or \\nindirect involvement in one or more Very Severe or Severe \\ncontroversies; or \\nA Green Flag indicates that a company either:  \\nHas fully or partially settled one or more Moderate controversies in \\nwhich it was involved; \\nIs indirectly implicated in one or more Ongoing Moderate \\ncontroversies; \\nPartially Concluded or Concluded Minor controversies; or \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 8 OF 53\\nExhibit 2: MSCI ESG controversy assessment scoring matrix (effective for \\ncontroversy cases reviewed after June 20, 2022) \\nMSCI ESG Controversies Flags are leveraged to identify corporate entities implicated \\nin third-party allegations concerning practices or incidents that may contradict \\nrecommendations under the following global norms and conventions: \\nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises;  \\nThe International Labour Organization's (ILO) fundamental conventions and ILO \\nFor additional details on the definition of Flag scales, refer to the ESG Symbols and \\nDefinitions available\\nhere\\n.\\nMSCI ESG Controversies is not designed to verify or confirm any allegations or \\nclaims of violations.

              "      <td>The Severity of each case is assessed based on the Nature of Harm and alleged \\nScale of Impact of the event, practices, products or businesses on the environment \\nand society. In some instances, the Severity assessment can be adjusted based on \\nexacerbating circumstances that include activities constituting deliberate action with \\nregard to social or environmental harm, or involve the most vulnerable ecosystems \\nor demographic groups. The Severity assessment may also be adjusted due to \\nextenuating circumstances. This adjustment is applied if a case is determined to be \\nlinked to a legacy issue that continues to present a reputational or legal risk to the \\ncompany.  \\nNature of Harm  \\nThe Nature of Harm is assessed on a scale ranging from Very Serious to Minimal \\nharm: \\nExhibit 4: Nature of Harm scale \\nVery Serious harm generally applies to events and actions that lead to irretrievable or \\nlong-lasting damage to the environment, result in fatalities, contribute to major \\nfinancial or economic crisis, or correspond to a most serious crime against \\nhumanity. \\nMinimal harm generally refers to cases where actual impact is projected in the \\nfuture. This includes cases alleging adverse impact of planned or forthcoming \\nactions, for example, protests against the construction of an oil pipeline based on \\nconcerns over possible adverse impact on land and water resources. \\nThe Scale of Impact is assessed on a scale ranging from Extremely Widespread to \\nLow. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 11 OF 53\\nExhibit 5: Scale of Impact \\nThe Scale of Impact is an assessment of the extent of the alleged harm and is \\ndetermined, for example, based on the size of the area or number of people affected, \\nthe size of the operating footprint of companies involved in high-impact controversial \\nactivity, and the number of regions or jurisdictions affected by high-impact \\ncontroversial business practices. Low Scale of Impact is attributed to controversies \\nthat have an undeterminable, but probable extent of harm where the impact is likely \\nto be insignificant. \\nSee Appendix B for more details and examples of Nature of Harm and Scale of \\nImpact assessments. \\nCombining Nature of Harm and Scale of Impact \\n and \\nScale of Impact\\n assessments are combined to reach an initial \\ndetermination of Severity; multiple scenarios can lead to the same Severity \\nassessment (see Exhibit 6). \\nExhibit 6: Initial assessment of controversy case Severity \\nNature of Harm \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 12 OF 53\\nExacerbating Circumstances \\nCertain circumstances may warrant a controversy case Severity assessment to be \\nadjusted: cases that have an Exacerbating Circumstance have a controversy \\nassessment that is more severe than otherwise would have been determined \\nthrough the Nature of Harm and Scale of Impact alone.  \\nExacerbating circumstances can be assessed if any of the following three criteria are \\nmet: \\n1)\\nVulnerable demographics\\nmost vulnerable demographics. See Appendix C for more details. \\n2)\\nVulnerable ecosystems\\nmost vulnerable ecosystems. MSCI ESG Research defines vulnerable \\necosystems as those included on the United Nations Educational, \\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List. \\n3)\\nDeliberate action\\n: controversy cases that arise from allegations that the \\ncompany, company's representatives or employees are involved in \\nactivities constituting deliberate action with regard to social or \\nenvironmental harm. These may include deliberate obstruction of \\ninvestigations, attempts to cover up the event or activity, or the \\npunishment or termination of employees voicing their concerns or \\nparticipating in protests against the company.  \\nExtenuating Circumstances \\nCertain situations may warrant a controversy case Severity assessment to be \\nadjusted based on extenuating circumstances. Cases that face such Extenuating \\nCircumstances have a controversy assessment that is less severe than otherwise \\nwould have been determined through the Nature of Harm and Scale of Impact alone.  \\nExtenuating Circumstances are assessed if a case is determined to be linked to a \\nlegacy issue that continues to present a reputational or legal risk to the company.  \\nMSCI ESG Research defines a legacy issue as the following: \\nA high-impact event that occurred 20 or more years ago (e.g., use of prison labor \\nduring World War II); or  \\nA high-impact product or practice that was discontinued and/or remediated 20 or \\nmore years ago (e.g., asbestos, lead paint, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], \\nperfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA][in some cases], perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl \\nsubstances [PFAS], hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], etc.). \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 13 OF 53\\nExhibit 7: Example of Severity assessment with exacerbating and extenuating \\ncircumstances triggers applied</td>\n",

The Role is assessed as either \\nDirect or Indirect. \\nMSCI ESG Research consider companies to have a direct involvement in an ESG \\ncontroversy if the negative impact is directly attributed to the company's actions, \\npractices, products or businesses; whereby harm could not have happened without \\nsuch actions or activities; or if the ESG controversy relates to an entity or a joint \\nventure in which the company has significant control. MSCI ESG Research's \\ndetermination of significant control is based specifically on the ownership structure \\nas disclosed by the company. If an entity has 30% ownership or higher or is a primary \\noperator in a joint venture project, it is assessed as having significant control.  \\nA company is implicated in a workplace incident that led to several employee \\nfatalities. \\nAn oil refining company is facing substantial community opposition to a pipeline \\nconstruction project that is carried out by a subsidiary of the company, of which \\nit owns 30% of the shares. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 14 OF 53\\nA medical device manufacturer is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by patients \\nwho sustained injuries linked to malfunction of the company's pacemakers. \\nMSCI ESG Research considers companies to have an indirect involvement in an ESG \\ncontroversy when the negative impact may have been facilitated by the company's \\nactions, practices, products or businesses, but the company is not considered as \\nplaying critical or essential role (e.g., it is involved as a supplier or a client of a \\ndirectly involved company, or when the company had a minority ownership (&lt;30%) in \\na company or joint venture involved in an ESG controversy case). Indirect Role is also \\nattributed to companies in cases of adverse impact due to natural causes (e.g., \\nearthquake, tsunami), whereby the company is still responsible for impact \\nremediation. \\nA company faces allegations of unsafe working conditions at one of its \\nsupplier's factories. \\nAn oil refining company is facing community opposition to a pipeline \\nconstruction project.

A lawsuit filed \\nby several workers claiming that the incident affected their health was \\ndismissed and not appealed. \\nA large food producer was criticized by NGO groups for using palm oil in \\nits products. Palm oil production is commonly linked to tropical forests \\ndestruction, loss of biodiversity and disturbance of natural carbon \\nstorage. The company has since completely discontinued its use of palm \\noil in food products and was not implicated in palm oil-sourcing \\ncontroversies. \\nSome Moderate- or Minor-Severity cases may be determined to be \\nConcluded without an intermediate Partially Concluded step due to a narrow \\nscope of impact that may require a simple resolution. Moderate or Severe \\ncases may also be classified as Concluded if targeted research seeking \\nupdated information has yielded no results for at least two consecutive \\nyears, subject to review and approval by designated methodology \\ncommittees (see \"MSCI ESG Controversies and Global Norms Methodology \\n- Process\" for details).  \\nInactive Cases \\nArchived\\n: Concluded cases with no new escalations are eventually assessed as \\nArchived and removed from companies' assessment and profiles.  \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 17 OF 53\\nDue to the narrow scope and low level of impact of Minor controversies, \\ncase conclusions are not often reached or reported. Therefore, Minor \\nOngoing cases can be assessed as Archived one year after a case's \\ninitiation if no further updates to the case are available.  \\nModerate ESG controversy cases are assessed as Archived one year \\nafter conclusion. \\nSevere and Very Severe ESG controversy cases are assessed as Archived \\nthree years after conclusion.  \\nHistorical Concern\\n: Certain Concluded cases may be determined to be high \\nprofile on a case-by-case basis where these form an important part of the \\ncompany's ESG history.

              "      <td>As the objective of MSCI ESG Controversies assessments is to highlight reputational \\nrisk to a company based on its alleged involvement in controversial practices or \\nevents, no averaging or weight adjustment of scores is applied. An Overall Company \\nScore is generally determined based on the lowest-scoring controversy case in which \\nthe company is involved. Unless there is a pattern of controversial involvement \\nwithin a specific Theme, this approach is applied through the entire ESG \\ncontroversies hierarchy structure (see Exhibit 11 for a detailed example): \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 22 OF 53\\nThematic Indicators receive the score corresponding to the lowest-scoring \\ncontroversy case within the same Theme. An additional score deduction may \\napply if a pattern of involvement in similar cases is established. \\nSub-Pillars receive the score corresponding to the lowest scoring Thematic \\nIndicator within the Sub-Pillar. \\nPillars receive the score corresponding to the lowest-scoring Sub-Pillar within \\nthe Pillar. \\nThe company's Overall Score is ultimately determined by the lowest-scoring \\nPillar. \\nExhibit 11: ESG Controversy Score propagation through the ESG controversies \\nhierarchy \\nExample: A company is not involved in any major environmental or governance controversies, but is \\ndirectly involved in an Ongoing Very Severe (Red Flag) case alleging use of child labor in an ethnic \\ncommunity subjected to systemic abuse, and three instances of workplace safety violations, two of \\nwhich resulted in injuries to several workers (Yellow Flags). \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 23 OF 53\\nTreatment of more than three cases within the same Theme \\nIn situations where companies have three or more non-Minor controversy cases \\nwithin the same Theme, the Theme Score is reduced by 1 point. This rule applies \\nonly at the Thematic Indicator level to reflect the greater reputational risk associated \\nwith multiple controversies of similar impact. There is no pattern-based score \\nadjustment within the same Sub-Pillar or Pillar. Cases with a score of 1 (Orange Flag) \\nor 0 (Red Flag) always result in a Thematic Indicator score of 1 or 0, respectively. \\nExhibit 12: Example: ESG Controversy Score propagation for a company with three \\nor more Product Safety &amp; Quality controversies \\nScores across individual cases, Thematic Indicators, Sub-Pillars, Pillars and at the \\ncompany level translate to a corresponding color Flag indicating the Severity of \\ncontroversies in which the company is involved. \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 24 OF 53\\nExhibit 13: Interpretation of a Company Flag \\nFlag\\nFlag Description\\nRed Flag:\\n indicates that a company is directly involved in one or more \\nVery Severe Ongoing controversies. \\nOrange Flag:\\n indicates that a company has either: \\ninvolvement in one or more Very Severe controversies,  \\ncontroversies, or \\nIs directly involved in one or more Ongoing Severe controversies. \\nYellow Flag:\\nHas been implicated in one or more Concluded Very Severe or \\nSevere controversies,  \\nHas settled at least some of the stakeholders' concerns related to \\nits alleged involvement in one or more Severe controversies or \\nindirect involvement in one or more Very Severe controversies, or \\ncontroversies.  \\nGreen Flag:\\nHas fully or partially settled one or more Moderate severity \\ncontroversies in which it was directly involved,  \\nIs indirectly implicated in one or more Moderate controversies, \\nPartially Concluded or Concluded Minor controversies, or \\nMSCI.COM | PAGE 25 OF 53</td>\n",

Neither these Signals nor any description of historical data are intended to provide investment advice or a \\nrecommendation to make (or refrain from making) any investment decision or asset allocation and should not be relied upon as such. Signals are \\ninherently backward-looking because of their use of historical data, and they are not intended to predict the future. The relevance, correlations and \\naccuracy of Signals frequently will change materially. \\nThe Information should not be relied on and is not a substitute for the skill, judgment and experience of the user, its management, employees, advisors \\nand/or clients when making investment and other business decisions. All Information is impersonal and not tailored to the needs of any person, entity \\nor group of persons. \\nNone of the Information constitutes an offer to sell (or a solicitation of an offer to buy), any security, financial product or other investment vehicle or any \\ntrading strategy.  \\nIt is not possible to invest directly in an index. Exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represented by an index is only available \\nthrough third party investable instruments (if any) based on that index. MSCI does not issue, sponsor, endorse, market, offer, review or otherwise express \\nany opinion regarding any fund, ETF, derivative or other security, investment, financial product or trading strategy that is based on, linked to or seeks to \\nprovide an investment return related to the performance of any MSCI index (collectively, \"Index Linked Investments\"). MSCI makes no assurance that \\nany Index Linked Investments will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns. MSCI Inc. is not an investment adviser or \\nfiduciary and MSCI makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in any Index Linked Investments. \\nIndex returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. MSCI maintains and calculates indexes, but does not manage \\nactual assets. The calculation of indexes and index returns may deviate from the stated methodology. Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales \\ncharges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or Index Linked Investments. The imposition of these fees and \\ncharges would cause the performance of an Index Linked Investment to be different than the MSCI index performance. \\nThe Information may contain back tested data. Back-tested performance is not actual performance, but is hypothetical. There are frequently material \\ndifferences between back tested performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strategy.  \\nConstituents of MSCI equity indexes are listed companies, which are included in or excluded from the indexes according to the application of the relevant \\nindex methodologies. Accordingly, constituents in MSCI equity indexes may include MSCI Inc., clients of MSCI or suppliers to MSCI. Inclusion of a security \\nwithin an MSCI index is not a recommendation by MSCI to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice. \\nData and information produced by various affiliates of MSCI Inc., including MSCI ESG Research LLC and Barra LLC, may be used in calculating certain \\nMSCI indexes. More information can be found in the relevant index methodologies on www.msci.com.  \\nMSCI receives compensation in connection with licensing its indexes to third parties.
